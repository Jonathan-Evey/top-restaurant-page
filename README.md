# top-restaurant-page

#### Restaurant Page Project

##### Technology used - HTML | CSS | JavaScript | WebPack

Project assignment from the Odin Project

Assignment details -

-   Use vanilla JS to create all pages of a restaurant website.
-   render each page when the corresponding tab is selected.

Execution -

-   I used JS Modules to separate the JS files, one for main functions, click events, and HTML rendering.
-   Styling was all done with base CSS.
-   It was not in the assignment to make the site responsive, but I made it responsive as a extra challenge.
